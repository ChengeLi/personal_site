## About me
Hello World!  ðŸ˜Ž

I am _Lexi Chenge Li_, a fourth year PhD student studying **machine learning** and **computer vision** at the [Video Lab](http://vision.poly.edu/index.html/) at New York University. My supervisor is Prof. [Yao Wang](http://eeweb.poly.edu/~yao/).


## Research Projects

#### Towards Solving Detection and Tracking Simutaneously

Object detection in 2D still images are already pretty successfully. With works such as faster rCNN, YOLO, SSD etc, we can already do real-	time object detection across multiple classes. What about videos? Can we do object detection in videos as accurate as in images now? What about tracking them? Is there a way to detect and track mutiple objects simutaneously? Is there a way to solve this more elegantly?


We will treat detection and tracking as one whole problem and try to tackle them at the same time.
